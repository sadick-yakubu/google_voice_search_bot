This is a simple Python program that allows you to perform Google searches using voice commands. It utilizes the SpeechRecognition library to transcribe audio input and the Selenium library to automate web browsing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Chrome web browser
- Selenium library (`pip install selenium`)
- SpeechRecognition library (`pip install SpeechRecognition`)

    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the program:

    ```
    python app.py
    ```

5. Speak a search query when prompted. For example, say "Search cats and dogs".

6. The program will open a Google search page in your default web browser with the search results.

## Customization

You can customize the behavior of the program by modifying the source code. For example, you can add more voice commands, change the default web browser, or improve error handling.
